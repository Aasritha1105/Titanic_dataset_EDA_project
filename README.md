Titanic EDA Project

This project involves performing an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. 
The goal is to clean, visualize, and analyze the data to extract meaningful insights.

Introduction
The Titanic dataset is a well-known dataset used in data science for exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling. 
This project aims to analyze the dataset to understand the characteristics of the passengers and factors affecting their survival.
The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset provided by Kaggle. 
It contains information about the passengers who were aboard the Titanic when it sank.
